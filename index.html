Fom an early age I have been deeply interested in technology, said interest is what led me to pursuit a career in <b>Information Engineering. In 2010 I started to study in Universidad Tecnologica del Centro, located in Guacara, Venezuela, in order to obtain a degree in the aforementioned career. During my studies I got to establish a projection about what professional profile I wanted to achieve, likewise I took the initiative to learn Front-End technologies like HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript. Throughout Octuber of 2015 I decided to work by myself to get more experience as a Web Developer, this way I got to build my first project: Areiro.com.  New projects came along 2015, with which I could put my knowledge into practice and learn new things, such as: Zurb Foundation and AngularJS; I used the latter to build this website.Currently I am expanding my knowledge in this area so I could be able to build and implement RESTful APIs.Moreover, I consider myself a Linux follower, I started to use it in 2009 and it was during 2010 that I decided to use it as my computers' main OS." />
